# Disease Classification in R using Decision Tree (Random Forest) and Multinomial Logistic Regression
### Algorithms Used:
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
<br>
***In the above project, we have done the following:
- Classified 42 diseases using Random Forest
- Acquired Feature Importance table and performed Feature Selection by selecting features above 75 percentile importance
- Used "New_Training" and "New_Testing" datasets to perform Multinomial Logistic Regression 
- EDA using a series of Visualizattions showing :
  - Missing Values
  - Correlation Matrix
  - Symptom frequencies ... and more!***
