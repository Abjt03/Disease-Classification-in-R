# Disease Classification in R using Decision Tree (Random Forest) and Multinomial Logistic Regression
### Algorithms Used:
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
### In the above project, we have done the following:  
- Classified 42 diseases using Random Forest  
- Acquired Feature Importance table and performed Feature Selection by selecting features above 75 percentile importance  
- Used "New_Training" and "New_Testing" datasets to perform Multinomial Logistic Regression   
- EDA using a series of Visualizations showing :  
  1. Missing Values  
  2. Correlation Matrix  
  3. Symptom frequencies ... and more!  
### Final Accuracy Values of the Algorithms Used:
- Random Forest : 97.619%
- Multinomial Logistic Regression : 92.8571%
#### From the above information : Random Forest Algorithm is preferred for the given problem statement.
