# Disease Classification in R using Decision Tree (Random Forest) and Multinomial Logistic Regression
### Algorithms Used:
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
<br/>
### In the above project, we have done the following:  <br/>  
- Classified 42 diseases using Random Forest  <br/>  
- Acquired Feature Importance table and performed Feature Selection by selecting features above 75 percentile importance  <br/>
- Used "New_Training" and "New_Testing" datasets to perform Multinomial Logistic Regression   <br/>
- EDA using a series of Visualizattions showing :  <br/>
  1. Missing Values  <br/>
  2. Correlation Matrix  <br/>
  3. Symptom frequencies ... and more!  <br/>
